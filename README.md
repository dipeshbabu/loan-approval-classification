# Bank Loan Classification

The objective of this task was to create a machine learning model capable of effectively determining whether a person's loan application was approved or rejected using the given information. The dataset ([Bank Loan Dataset](https://github.com/dipeshbabu/loan-approval-classification/tree/main/data)) comprises 15 columns, containing various attributes like age, gender, income, education level, and others. The focus was on predicting the "Personal Loan" column, which serves as the target variable.
